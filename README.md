# Introduction

Logic decryption tool for the paper: Double DIP: Re-Evaluating Security of Logic Encryption Algorithms

For installation and usage, please refer to SAT Attack. Here is the link: https://bitbucket.org/spramod/host15-logic-encryption

# Example

For a benchmark encrypted with the combination of traditional logic encryption technique and SARLock, run the following command to decrypt the key of traditional logic encryption technique:

./sld ../../benchmarks_sarlock/iolts14/ex5_enc05.bench ../../benchmarks_sarlock/original/ex5.bench
